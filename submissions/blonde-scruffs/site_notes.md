Hey there! We're Team Blonde Scruffs, and this is our French Ed hackathon submission.

This project involved a live website that can be [accessed right here!](http://fredhack.lightningfruitbox.com)

Actual url: http://fredhack.lightningfruitbox.com

The files contained in 'git files' include a wordpress theme directory ('fredhack') and SQL database (fredhack.sql), which can be uploaded to any clean wordpress install to duplicate the demo site above.

Any questions about the site, just fire an email over to [lars@lightningfruit.com](mailto:lars@lightningfruit.com)!
